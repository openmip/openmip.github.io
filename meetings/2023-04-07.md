### Outline

- [Solving Mixed Integer Programs Using Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13349)
  - Neural Diving
    - Diving is a kind of primal heuristic and can be combined in the procudre of Branch and Bound
    - Train a generative model over the assignments to integer variables
  - Neural Branch
    - Learn to choose which variable to branch
    - Imitation Learning for Full Strong Branch (FSB)
- [A GNN-Guided Predict-and-Search Framework for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05636)
  - Neural Diving with Trust Region
